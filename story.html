    <h5 class="card-title">Azad's story " Lost in the desert, alive with hope"</h5>
    <p class="card-text">My name is Azad. I was 15 years old when I left everything behind to find a better life.

Back home, I was a student, full of dreams. I dropped out of school and decided to cross into a country illegally. The journey was brutal. Days passed with nothing but hunger, thirst, and fear.

In that country life as an undocumented migrant was harsh. We had to hide from the police. I worked in a factory, doing heavy labor just to survive. I was only a boy, but life didn’t care. I had to grow up fast.

One winter, I decided to risk everything and go to next country which I believed there were more opportunities there. I paid a smuggler, and with 15 others, we crossed the border. But before we reached safety, we were captured by armed thieves in the mountains.

That was the beginning of the worst days of my life.

They beat us. Starved us. Left us tied up in the desert. My family had to pay ransom to free me. For a whole week, I didn’t know if I would survive. But somehow, I did.

Now, I look back and realize I was just a kid. But I survived things grown men fear. I crossed deserts, hid in shadows, and kept walking.</p>
    <p class="card-text"><small class="text-body-secondary">To every young person fighting for their life in silence:
You are not weak. You are a warrior. Never forget how far you've already come.</small></p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Sara's story</h5>
    <p class="card-text">My name is Sara. I’m 20 years old and a university student today, but my journey to this point was not easy.

Four years ago, everything in my life turned upside down. My father was a street vendor after the regime changed, and our lives became uncertain. We were waiting on a resettlement case, and one day, the call came we had to move to another country for paperwork. Full of hope, we sold everything we had and left.

At first, I believed we would get a visa quickly. I thought, "Maybe soon, everything will be okay." But it didn’t happen like that. We had to wait. One year passed. Then two. When we finally received our visas, I was hopeful again, but moving to a new country brought new struggles.

The first year was the hardest of my life. I got sick, mentally and physically. I didn’t know the language. I was isolated. I used to dream of freedom, but instead, I felt trapped in my own mind. There were moments when the pain was so deep, I didn’t want to live anymore.

Eventually, I received treatment. Slowly, I began to heal. But just when I started to feel a little better, I lost my father. His absence left a hole in my heart that may never be filled.

Now, I stand stronger not because I had no pain, but because I survived it. Migration taught me patience, pain, and how to start again.</p>
    <p class="card-text"><small class="text-body-secondary">To anyone going through their own storm:
You are not alone. Even in silence, your voice matters. Keep going. Your story is still being written.</small></p>

    <h5 class="card-title"> Safia </h5>
    <p class="card-text">My name is Safia, and I’m a mother of three. For the past three years, I have lived in a refugee camp without my husband  just me and my children, trying to survive one day at a time.

When we first arrived, I was full of fear and uncertainty. My husband was taken away shortly after we crossed the border. I didn’t know if I would ever see him again. I suddenly became the only parent, the only protector, and the only provider for my children.

Life in the camp is nothing like what people imagine. The tents are cold in the winter, and scorching hot in the summer. We stand in line for hours just to get food, sometimes just bread and rice. Clean water is limited. Privacy is almost nonexistent. I have to bathe my children behind makeshift blankets, and I sleep every night worrying about their safety.

Many nights, I cried quietly after putting the children to sleep. There were days when I felt invisible  not seen, not heard. Being a woman alone in the camp was especially difficult. Some people treated me with pity, others with suspicion. I had to be strong in front of my kids, even when I felt broken inside.

But in the middle of all this darkness, I still found reasons to keep going. I taught my children letters using a piece of cardboard and a pen someone gave me. I made friends with other women in the camp  we shared stories, tears, and sometimes a piece of bread when one of us had nothing.

I’ve learned how to fix torn clothes, how to make toys from trash, and how to smile even when my heart is tired.

I still don’t know what the future holds. I don’t know if my husband will come back. But I know this: I didn’t give up. For my children, I stayed strong. For them, I will keep walking  no matter how long the journey.</p>
    <p class="card-text"><small class="text-body-secondary">To every mother living between tents and waiting lines, 
you are not alone.
Your strength is quiet, but powerful.
Even in the harshest places, love and courage still live.</small></p>
